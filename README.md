btcsentry
=========

An application to monitor Bitcoin markets and notify you when shit hits the fan.

Description
-----------

This application watches the Bitcoin markets via [Bitcoin Charts](http://www.bitcoincharts.com/) and notifies you when specific events occur.

BTC Sentry is exceptionally basic right now, and is intended for my personal use. I may or may not expand on it at a later date.

It's essentially a looping JSON fetcher from the Bitcoin Charts [Markets API](http://bitcoincharts.com/about/markets-api/).

Install
-------

  * Download the applicate `wget https://github.com/f3ndot/btcsentry/zipball/master`
  * Run `bundle install` to get the dependencies 

Usage
-----

  * You're a big boy, you can figure it out now, can't you? 
  * Ok, fine. Run `ruby ./path/to/btcsentry.rb` in your terminal.
